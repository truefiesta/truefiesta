### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# My name is Yulia.

I'm a **front-end developer** based in Sydney ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º.

Most often I use these technologies and tools:

- **for development**: JavaScript, React, Redux, HTML, CSS
- **for testing**: Jest, Enzyme
- **for bundling**: Webpack
- **for prototyping**: Figma, Adobe Illustrator.
